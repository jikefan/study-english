# Desigin Patterns

## What's a design pattern?

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Benefits of patterns

Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common problems in software design. They define a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.

## Classification

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition, they  can be categorized by their intent and divided into          three groups.

# Classification of patterns

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed, I like the analogy to road construction :you can make an intersection safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire multi-level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians.

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. They  usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most  universal and high-level patterns and architectural patterns.Developers can implement there patterns in virtually and language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architectural of an entire application.

In addtion, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose .This  book covers three main groups of patterns:

- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanism that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structure patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into large structures, while keeping these structures flexibility and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
